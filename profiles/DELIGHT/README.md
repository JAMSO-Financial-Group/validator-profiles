# DELIGHT

DELIGHT is a technology-driven team that has made a long journey with the growing decentralized platform from the very early stage and contributed to the ecosystem's prosperity in diverse ways.
Our business has started from running validators and is now expanding to a validator delegated operating service, DEX named Terraswap, and more decentralized applications to be released in the near future.

## Team

We have 7 fast-learning engineers and 1 keen designer based in South Korea, and almost all engineers have the building experience for a mainnet integrated with consensus and application layers. Validator and service operations driven by our team, widely known as stable and secure, show this high level of expertise. In addition, the designer has many experiences in various web products, including well-known companies around Manhattan.
Proficiency in varied programming languages is also a strength of the team. We have been actively working to enhance the stability of the networks we support by developing our own solutions that analyze the state and data of validators.

## Our Architecture

In over 10 networks, including SKALE, Terra, Oasis, we operate validators and full nodes on multiple clouds with 24/7 technical support. Additionally, we are running our own Geth so that empowers NuCypher nodes' performance and stability.

## Ecosystem Contributions

DELIGHT has been a participant since the beginning of the testnet and WorkLock and passed all phases of CASI (Come and Stake It, NuCypher's Incentivized Testnet) with high scores. We have also made active feedback to assist a more reliable network, such as an issue regarding Ursula status page certificate. Even by serving node delegation operation for Hashed, one of the most prominent VCs in the blockchain industry and SNU Cryptolabs, the institute most famous for homomorphic encryption, we contribute to NuCypher's ecosystem.
