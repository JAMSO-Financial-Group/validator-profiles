At Figment our mission is to support the wider adoption, growth and long term success of stake based protocols. 
This is Figmentâ€™s unique approach to Proof of Stake: we provide not just enterprise-grade delegation services to token holders,
we build open source software such as the Hubble staking explorer, real world compliance & reporting tools, and actively 
participate in community & governance.
